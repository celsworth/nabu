		Hi. You've reached Chris Elsworth's personal website. This is
		still very much a work-in-progress and most pages are still being
		written.

	%p
		I'm a programmer based in Solihull UK, currently contracting for
		%a{href: '//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Research_%26_Development'}
			BBC Research &amp; Development,
		with a history in ISP sysadmin at
		%a{href: '//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Internet'} Demon Internet.

	%p
		I mostly do Ruby and C, and there's a couple of iOS apps with
		my name on them.

		Recently I'm also developing an interest in microprocessor
		(Atmel AVR and Espressif ESP8266) programming and the electronics
		associated with such things.


	%p
		I'll fill this out with more as things occur to me.
